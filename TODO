- Some crates just have lib.rs without a src folder. Handle this case.

### Downloader
- Downloader handle 404 response -> done
- Only download if that specific version doesn't already exist -> done

### Main part
- Start with parsing only the current crates features and solving it
- Go one level at a time into the dependency chain
